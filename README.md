# Hi, my name is Yara.
## I am migrating careers to work as a DevOps Engineer.

I am well-versed in Linux, with a certificate from LinuxTips School, and also have a good understanding of AWS and its tools and resources. I have been studying networks, Docker and other tools related to the job of a DevOps Engineer. I'm currently creating projects to add to this portfolio, in order to start working as a Junior or Trainee in this field.

### Main Skills:
* Linux
* AWS (IAM, EC2, CloudWatch, Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, RDS, SNS, Route53, VPC and Amplify)

*I am looking for a beginner's project to participate, contribute and build my skills*
